## 🚀 About Me 
Hi, I’m Isabella Herrera, a Finance & Computer Science double major with a strong interest in data analysis and business intelligence.

I previously worked as a Business Intelligence Intern in the Quality Department at Franklin Electric, where I applied data-driven thinking to real-world business problems. In this role, I strengthened my skills in Excel, Power BI, data analysis, and problem-solving, supported ongoing analytics initiatives, and gained hands-on experience working with structured business data in a professional environment.

Beyond coursework, I actively invest in building my technical skill set. I recently earned the CompTIA Data+ certification, validating my knowledge of data analysis, data visualization, data governance, and translating data into actionable insights.

As a student-athlete, I’ve developed strong discipline, time management, and consistency—skills that translate directly into how I approach analytics projects and team collaboration. I’m reliable, detail-oriented, and motivated by continuous learning.

I’m currently seeking entry-level roles in data analysis, business analytics, or financial analytics, where I can contribute immediately while continuing to grow technically and professionally.
